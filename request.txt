Hello,I am very interested in your project,and you are very impressed with the code you write.However,I am a student and have just come into contact with C++,and it's hard to see your source code in the future.I hope you can give me some help.For example,would it be convenient for you to pass some of your notes or other understandable documents to me,Thank you.
